# LinearRegression
This repository contains LinearRegression modelling across different datasets

Following features have been used w.r.t modellling in python

1. VIF analysis
2. Feature selection using p-value and correlation
3. Minimising autocorrelation using Durbin-Watson metrics
4. Outlier detection and removal

In addition to this, following techniques have been used

1. statsmodels OLS
2. scikit learn Linear Regression
3. scikit learn train test split
4. scikit learn metrics -> R squared and Mean squared error
